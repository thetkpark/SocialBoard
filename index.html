<p>COVID-19 has brought us a lot of inconvenience but I tend to look on the brighter side of the picture, which is how Microsoft Build 2020 went digital and that means it’s easily accessible for people anywhere and at anytime!</p>

<p>Hi everyone! I’ll be doing a bunch of activities at MS Build 2020 but the one that students will love is a mindful programming activity: creating a terrarium with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - no filler! Enjoy some hand-drawn succulents and craft a draggable interface where you can situate your plants in a terrarium created with just CSS. It’s actually quite relaxing!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To view the final terrarium, clone or download <a href="https://github.com/jlooper/my-terrarium">the repo</a> using the Master branch. To code along with me in the session, use the Student branch, which is incomplete. There are steps delineated where you need to complete the code - don’t miss edits to the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.</p>
<p>When you’re done, view the terrarium locally by opening index.html in your browser, or commit your code to your GitHub account and use GitHub Pages to view it.</p>
<p>To do that, go to your GitHub repo where your terrarium lives and connect GitHub pages to the appropriate branch (probably your master branch) in Settings.</p>
<p>Enjoy your lovely terrarium! And tell me what you think of the experience (I’m on Twitter @jenlooper)!</p>

<p>Learning coding concepts from experts and afficionados all for free!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although I have coded before, the idea of attending a developer conference seemed scary to me. I thought the content would go right
over my head, or that I would feel antagonized as woman in CS. I was pleased to find that this wasn’t the case. Through
interactive sessions that were tailored for students and which featured several female presenters, I got the satisfaction of
<code>Build succesful</code> rather than the frustration of a <code>Runtime Error</code>. I have learned a lot in these past 8 hours, and I hope the next
two days will be better and better!</p>

/*Overview

Rust is used for almost anything and everything 

Used to write low level modules for Windows that were originally written in C/C++

Statically typed.

Cargo is the build system for Rust

Create a project for a guessing game by typing &quot;cargo new new_guessing_game&quot; in the terminal. A directory will be created called new_guessing_game.

A cargo.toml configuration file is created in that directory.

Install the random library by typing &lt;code&gt;rand = &quot;0.7.3&quot;&lt;\code&gt; underneath &quot;[dependencies]&quot; in cargo.toml (line 9).

For more information: https://www.rust-lang.org/

*/

use std::io;//import the standard i/o library
use rand::Rng;//random number library
use std::cmp::Ordering; //compare 2 values and whether they are greater than, less than or equal to.

fn main() {
    

    //generate a random number between 1 and 10
    let number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1,11);

    //infinite loop
    loop{      

        println!(&quot;Guess a number b/w 1 and 10&quot;);

        //create a mutable var. By default vars are immutable in Rust
        let mut guess = String::new();

        //access the variable without copying it to memory. (Pass by reference).
        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&amp;mut guess)
            .expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);


        println!(&quot;You guessed: {}&quot;, guess);

        //convert the string guess into a 32 bit integer by first trimming the string and then parsing it into an integer.
        let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect(&quot;Please type a number.&quot;);
        //above we `shadowed` the variable guess with a new one so that we didn't have to worry about creating new variables.
        
        println!(&quot;The number is {}&quot;, number);

        match guess.cmp(&amp;number){

            Ordering::Less =&gt; {println!(&quot;Too Low&quot;);}
            Ordering::Greater =&gt; {println!(&quot;Too high&quot;);}
            Ordering::Equal =&gt; {println!(&quot;You win!&quot;); break;}

        }

        //We can also use standar if/else statements to compare numbers

        // if guess &lt; number {
        //     println!(&quot;Low&quot;);
        // }


    }
    
}


//now run by typing `cargo run` in the command line
